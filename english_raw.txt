Multilingualism is the use of more than one language, either by an individual speaker or by a group of speakers. It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world's population.[1][2] More than half of all Europeans claim to speak at least one language other than their mother tongue;[3] but many read and write in one language. Being multilingual is advantageous for people wanting to participate in trade, globalization and cultural openness.[4] Owing to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet, individuals' exposure to multiple languages has become increasingly possible. People who speak several languages are also called polyglots.[5]

Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called first language (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is usually acquired without formal education, by mechanisms about which scholars disagree.[6] Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other.[7]

People who speak more than one language have been reported to be better at language learning when compared to monolinguals.[8]

Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between internationalization and localization. Due to the status of English in computing, software development nearly always uses it (but not in the case of non-English-based programming languages). Some commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.
People are always guessing what is going to happen in the future. It may be, ‘Is it going to rain tomorrow?’ ‘Will my team win the league?’ or  ‘Do you think I should invest my money in this company?’ Predicting the future is part of our daily life and our everyday conversation. You don’t have to be a Nostrodamus to try to predict what will happen in the future.

Despite being around for several years now, Stardew Valley still hasn't lost its charm as an adorable farming simulator. However, this game is about more than planting crops and caring for animals — it's also about building a new life in a new town. Part of that involves getting to know the villagers and becoming part of the community…and maybe even getting married and starting a family in Pelican Town.

Stardew Valley: Decorative Plants Guide
If you’re looking to elevate your house’s interior design in Stardew Valley, Decorative Plants are the key; here's how you can acquire them.

There are twelve candidates — six bachelors and six bachelorettes — that the player can choose to romance and potentially marry. Each is unique, and will appeal to different players. Romancing each individual requires accounting for each NPC's preferences and personality, but the overall process of building a relationship and getting married in Stardew Valley remains the same.

Updated March 20, 2024 by Mohsen Baqery: In the extensive March Update (V1.6), Stardew Valley underwent a significant overhaul, introducing a plethora of new content. Notably, the realm of romance and marital life has seen substantial changes in this latest version. With this in mind, we've revised this post to provide updated information on these aspects, focusing on the introduction of the honeymoon period, a new balance adjustment designed to mitigate rocky starts to marriages.

How To Increase Friendship in Stardew Valley
stardew-valley-gift
To win over a potential spouse, players must increase their relationship by talking to them regularly, giving them gifts, performing quests, and more. There are plenty of ways to raise one's heart level with a character, but the easiest and fastest is through gifts. Click on a character in the Social tab (the tab with the heart) of the game's menu to see their gift preferences. Alternatively, check out this guide for suggestions on the best gifts in the game.

Players can give an NPC up to two gifts per week, plus an extra gift on their birthday, which can be found on the calendar outside Pierre's store. Birthday gifts will count for 8x the usual friendship points, so choose these presents extra carefully.

Starting A Relationship in Stardew Valley

Once the player reaches eight hearts with at least one bachelor or bachelorette, they will receive a letter from Pierre. He will note that the player appears to be growing close to some of the townsfolk, and remark that it is a local tradition to give bouquets to indicate romantic interest. At that point, the player will be able to purchase a Bouquet from Pierre's shop for 600g.

This guide will help Stardew Valley players learn how to effectively reel in fish and become skilled fishers.

Upon gifting a bouquet to a marriage candidate, if they are at eight hearts with the player, they will react with delighted surprise and declare that they feel the same way. At this time, the final two grayed-out hearts in their social gauge will open up, and the player can build their relationship to ten hearts. In the social menu, that character will also be listed as the player's "boyfriend" or "girlfriend."

Before getting married, the player can have as many boyfriends and/or girlfriends as they wish (although dating all the bachelors or all the bachelorettes at once may lead to a cutscene calling the player out). However, once the player is married, giving a bouquet to another NPC will upset their spouse.

Proposal & Wedding
stardew valley
On rainy days, an NPC called the Old Mariner will appear on the eastern side of the Beach. If the player has reached ten hearts with one of the bachelors or bachelorettes and has upgraded the Farmhouse at least once, he will offer to sell them a Mermaid Pendant. In the local tradition of Stardew Valley, this necklace is like an engagement ring: presenting it to one's beloved serves as a marriage proposal. Players can purchase it for 5,000 Gold.

To propose, players must have 10 hearts with their boyfriend or girlfriend, then give the Mermaid Pendant to their intended spouse as they would any other gift. Similar to the bouquet, the recipient will react joyfully and agree to marry the player. Three days after the proposal, as soon as the player wakes up, a cutscene will play of the marriage ceremony in the town square. Afterward, the player and their new spouse will appear on the farmhouse porch at 6am, ready to start the first day of their life together.
In the 1.6 Update of Stardew Valley, couples now embark on a 7-day honeymoon upon getting married. During this honeymoon period, your spouse is less likely to spend the entire day in bed as a sign of sadness. Before this update, the initial days of marriage could be challenging for some players. Reports surfaced of newly married couples experiencing communication issues, with spouses often remaining in bed and inaccessible, preventing players from seeking their assistance.

In addition to the honeymoon period, another significant change has been implemented in Stardew Valley marriages: the minimum heart level threshold for depression is now adjustable through regular acts of affection, such as kissing your spouse and consistently giving them gifts. The updated heart level threshold operates on a points system tied to the previous day’s interactions. For instance, if you kissed your spouse yesterday, the minimum threshold for a day of bedridden sadness will be set at 11. If you both kissed them and presented them with a loved gift, the threshold will decrease to 10.

List of Changes to Marriage in V1.6
stardew valley 1.6 update new features 
Here’s everything about marriage in Stardew Valley that’s changed with the 1.6 Update:

After earning 14 hearts, you will be able to purchase your spouse’s portrait, a decorative item you can hang on the farmhouse’s wall.
Your friendship gain with your spouse will be 33% slower.
There is only a 5% chance for your spouse to say something negative in the afternoon.
Some bugs relating to your spouse have been fixed. Your lover won’t water other player’s crops. They will no longer lie about doing the chores. And there will be no invisible spouses asking you for kids.

SUMMARY
Get ready for more bloodshed in the 50th Hunger Games in Suzanne Collins' upcoming book, Sunrise on the Reaping.
Haymitch's traumatic experience as a victor will finally be explored in detail, revealing the brutality of the Quarter Quell.
The book might serve as a fitting conclusion to the Hunger Games franchise, shedding light on Snow's personal war with District 12.

Author Suzanne Collins has announced her new book, Sunrise on the Reaping, which will finally dive into the most brutal tournament of the Hunger Games franchise. This is undoubtedly saying something since the Hunger Games featured in Collins's books see children between the ages of 12 and 17 brutally kill each other until only one is left standing. However, the teased setting of Sunrise on the Reaping indicates that the upcoming book will follow the events of the 50th Hunger Games, which Collins' previous novels revealed to have changed all the rules.

Sunrise on the Reaping is Collins' second prequel to her The Hunger Games trilogy, with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes released in 2020. The author has stated that the new novel will pick up 40 years after the end of Coriolanus Snow's prequel and begin on the morning of District 12's reaping. She went on to explain (via Variety) that the tale was inspired by the work of Scottish philosopher David Hume and the idea of "implicit submission." This is certainly intriguing, especially since it seems Sunrise on the Reaping will explore this through more bloodshed.

Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping Release Date, Story, Updates & Everything We Know
Suzanne Collins has announced details about the upcoming novel in the Hunger Games series, which will be titled Sunrise on the Reaping.

Sunrise On The Reaping Will Cover Haymitch's Hunger Games
Haymitch Was the Victor Of The 50th Hunger Games
Woody Harrelson as Haymitch holding a glass of alcohol in The Hunger Games

Though Collins' big Hunger Games novel announcement didn't mention Haymitch by name, the fact that the story is set 40 years after The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is enough to confirm that the titular reaping will be for the 50th Hunger Games, which Haymitch Abernathy participated. This is highly exciting since Hunger Games fans have been requesting a Haymitch prequel since Catching Fire gave a sneak peek into his games.

Katniss' mentor was an alcoholic with symptoms of trauma, and there has never been any question that this came as the result of his games. Haymitch rarely talked about his experience in the arena, but while preparing for the third Quarter Quell, Katniss and Peeta watched recordings of his reaping and tournament, hoping it would help them understand their own Quell. What they saw revealed a great deal about Haymitch's character, as well as the cruelty of the Capitol.

The Sunrise on the Reaping book will be released on March 18, 2025, and a movie adaptation has already been confirmed with a release date of November 20, 2026.

Why The Second Quarter Quell Was The Bloodiest In Panem's History
The 50th Hunger Games Changed All The Rules
Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy Glaring in The Hunger Games Catching Fire
Just as Katniss and Peeta's Quarter Quell changed the rules by requiring the tributes to be selected from the existing pool of victors, Snow also made some adjustments to the second Quarter Quell. The 50th Hunger Games demanded twice as many tributes as usual—two boys and two girls from each District. Therefore, rather than 23 dead tributes at the end, the victor of the second Quarter Quell would have the corpses of 47 children on their conscience, including three from their own District.

Rather than 23 dead tributes at the end, the victor of the second Quarter Quell would have the corpses of 47 children on their conscience.

Since the 50th Hunger Games contained twice as much bloodshed, it was easily the most brutal game in Panem's history, and this will make the upcoming Sunrise on the Reaping even more devastating to read. What's more, the Gamemakers of the second Quarter Quell raised the bar with the arena, whichappeared to be a colorful, tropical paradise but was instead a poisonous and deadly hellscape. Haymitch's time in the arena should be much longer and full of even more twists, turns, and devastating murders than previous Hunger Games novels.

Sunrise On The Reaping May Be The Hunger Games' Grand Finale
Haymitch Is The Last District 12 Victor To Get Their Own Story


A prequel featuring Haymitch's games was heavily requested, but this wasn't the only prominent idea from fans. Books following Finnick, Mags, or Joanna have also been begged for in recent years. However, Collins' choices in prequels so far indicate that this might not happen. All of the author's existing Hunger Games books feature games won by District 12 tributes. The Hunger Games saw Katniss and Peeta claim victory, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes explored Lucy Gray's games, and now, Sunrise on the Reaping will cover the last of them, Haymitch.

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes revealed that District 12 carries some painful significance with President Snow, which puts into perspective the rage he would have felt when Katniss Everdeen forced the Gamemakers' hands with those berries. Sunrise on the Reaping will see Haymitch, the first District 12 victor since Lucy Gray, win his games in just as controversial away. As a whole, Collins' five Hunger Games books would outline Snow's personal war with District 12. Any other prequels (or sequels) would disrupt this rather effective formula.

The second Quarter Quell would have been Snow's pride and joy—the greatest and most spectacular Hunger Games in Panem's history.

Moreover, the extreme nature of Haymitch's games makes them the perfect capper for the book franchise. The second Quarter Quell would have been Snow's pride and joy—the greatest and most spectacular Hunger Games in Panem's history. The fact that it was sabotaged by a District 12 tribute would have been enough to break something within the president. Like Balad of Songbirds and Snakes, the new book will provide further context for why Snow saw Katniss as such a threat. For this reason, Sunrise on the Reaping would make for a perfect full-circle ending.

The Peaky Blinders movie has been officially greenlit with Cillian Murphy reprising his role as Tommy Shelby, but the protagonist isn't the only character who needs to return. Netflix officially confirmed that The Peaky Blinders movie is happening and that Murphy will be part of the project, meaning the hit drama series can finally appear on the big screen. Peaky Blinders first debuted in 2013 and concluded almost a decade later. The gritty British crime show became popular all around the world and received incredible reviews, leading to rumors about a potential movie.

While the show's creator, Steven Knight, has been vocal about a movie, the project still had an element of doubt, but Netflix's confirmation means the iconic gang can finally continue their story. Despite Peaky Blinders season 6's perfect ending, the series left room for the characters to return, and with the movie's official announcement, it's no surprise the show's protagonist will be back. However, it is unclear who else will be reprising their role, but with Tommy's journey continuing, several characters have to join him in returning for the Peaky Blinders movie.

Daryl McCormack As Isiah Jesus
Isiah Jesus May Have A Bigger Role In The Peaky Blinders Movie
Isiah looking serious in Peaky Blinders
Isiah Jesus is one of the Peaky Blinders' younger members, but he has remained loyal to the group throughout his time with them. He has always been a reliable soldier by following in his father's footsteps and dedicating himself to the gang. Unfortunately, Isiah's father, Jeremiah, is unlikely to feature in the movie as Benjamin Zephaniah passed away in 2023 after playing the character since season 1. While this is a huge blow for Peaky Blinders and the acting world as a whole, it also gives the movie a reason to bring back Isiah.

He was still on good terms with the gang, and if the franchise opts to write out Jeremiah as opposed to recasting him, Isiah could have an elevated role. The movie could put a spotlight on Isiah by having him honor his father's history with the crew and taking on similar responsibilities, making him even more central to the story. This would be a great way of having a popular character return for the movie, while also paying respect to how important Zephaniah's legacy was to the series.

Charles Shelby
Tommy's Son Is Central To The Overall Story
Billy Jenkins as Charles Shelby in Peaky Blinders season 6
Given story details are still scarce regarding the Peaky Blinders movie, it is unclear how far into the future the film may be set, meaning Billy Jenkins may not be suitable to reprise the role. However, regardless of who portrays Charles Shelby, the character has to return for the new film. Charles may not be the most popular member of the Shelby family in Peaky Blinders, but there is no denying he holds a crucial role in the story, especially when it comes to Tommy.

Tommy's children are undoubtedly a big part of his character arc, as his daughter's death took a heavy toll on him. Likewise, Charlie being kidnapped in season 3 was another crucial event in Tommy's life that made his story so intriguing. With Charles surviving the finale, it seems inevitable he will be involved in the film in some capacity. Whether he is still a child and has a small cameo or has grown older and shown interest in the gang, Charlie should have an appearance to remind the audience of his importance.

8
Anya Taylor-Joy As Gina Gray
Gina's Return Could Tie In With The Boston Spinoff
Anya Taylor-Joy as Gina Gray in Peaky Blinders
Anya Taylor-Joy's return as Gina Gray would give the Peaky Blinders movie a connection to the upcoming Boston spinoff alongside some extra box office pedigree. The movie is one of several Peaky Blinders spinoffs that have been confirmed, and with a new show taking place in Boston, Gina provides the perfect connection. Although Michael was killed off in the final season, Gina survived and headed back to America, but her fate after this is unknown. Gina had connections to Boston as her uncle was a gangster with plenty of power in the city, meaning she could appear in the spinoff.

This would be the perfect reason to have Taylor-Joy reprise her role in the movie as well since it could link the two. Gina was supposedly pregnant with Michael's child before she died, meaning she still has connections to the Shelby family despite their disdain towards her. Therefore, this could give her a reason to return from a story perspective, and with Taylor-Joy becoming a huge name in Hollywood, it would add some star power to appear alongside Murphy.

7
Packy Lee As Johnny Dogs
Johnny Dogs Is One Of The Gang's Longest Serving Allies
Packy Lee as Johnny Dogs and Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders season 5
Although Johnny Dogs wasn't the most violent member of the Peaky Blinders gang, he did get his hands dirty when required and proved to be one of Tommy's most trustworthy men. Johnny has been part of the show since season 1, and if the crew is making their way to the big screen, it wouldn't feel right proceeding without him. He was often the voice of reason in the show, and Tommy's empire would never have grown as large as it did without him.

Johnny was never too deeply involved in some of the most gritty and bloody fights, but he was always there for the crew, and it would be tough to explain his absence. If the Peaky Blinders are in conflict, it would feel out of character for Johnny to have no interest, making his appearance a necessity. While the film could write him out and give him a more peaceful conclusion, it would make more sense to include Johnny and give him his happy ending on the big screen.

6
Ned Dennehy As Charlie Strong
Charlie's Relationship With The Shelby's Means He Must Return
Ned Dennehy as Charlie Strong with a cigarette in his mouth in Peaky Blinders
Much like Johnny Dogs, Charlie Strong has been a long-serving ally to the Peaky Blinders and has an even closer relationship with the Shelby family. He is the non-biological uncle of Tommy, Arthur, Ada, and Finn after his sister married into the family, making him a reliable member of the gang. His wisdom and experience meant he was an ever-present part of the Peaky Blinders' operations, and it only makes sense that he appears once again.

Outside his involvement with the crew, he was also a big part of Shelby Company Limited, and often focused on the more legitimate business practices like taking care of horses. Although Charlie may not have a huge role in the movie given he isn't one of the more violent members, his involvement with the gang and the Shelby family makes him a major part of the Peaky Blinders franchise, and the film would benefit from having Ned Dennehy reprising his role.

5
Conrad Khan As Duke Shelby
Tommy's Eldest Son Could Play A Pivotal Part In The Movie
Conrad Khan as Duke Shelby and Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders season 6
While the inclusion of Tommy's illegitimate son could have damaged Peaky Blinders' final season, Duke Shelby proved to be a great addition and should return for the film. Duke helped uncover the traitor within the Peaky Blinders gang and saved Isiah Jesus' life in the process, instantly proving his value to the gang. This makes him the perfect successor to Tommy in the criminal world and if Peaky Blinders is to continue without Cillian Murphy in the future, Conrad Khan's Duke could be the next protagonist.

Focusing more on Duke's role within the gang makes sense, especially as his feud with Finn is already set up. Finn was kicked out of the Peaky Blinders and the Shelby family cut ties with him, making him swear revenge on Duke. If the franchise does choose to explore this story down the line, it makes sense to make Duke feel even more pivotal to the story and elevate his role; therefore, an appearance in the movie is the perfect way to do so.

4
Tom Hardy As Alfie Solomons
Alfie's Popularity Among The Audience Means He Should Be Involved
Tom Hardy as Alfie Solomons wearing a hat in Peaky Blinders
Alfie Solomons is one of the most popular characters in Peaky Blinders, meaning a return for the movie is needed. Tom Hardy is one of the biggest names associated with the show, and it is no surprise he also played one of the best characters. Although Alfie acted as an antagonist at times, he often found a way to coexist with Tommy, creating a strange alliance that audiences loved. Given his ties to Boston, Alfie Solomons could appear in the Peaky Blinders spinoff, but like Gina, a movie cameo would be fitting.

Hardy's character was seemingly killed off at one point, but returned later in the series, proving his presence in Peaky Blinders is inevitable. While seeing Hardy continue his role in the spinoff would be welcomed, it would be a waste not to have him feature in the franchise's big screen debut as well, suggesting he needs to be a part of the project. Regardless of what role Alfie played, fans would be over the moon to see the character interact with Tommy one last time, emphasizing that the movie should include him at all costs.

Natasha O'Keeffe As Lizzie Shelby
Lizzie Was Crucial To Tommy's Survival In The Final Season
Natasha O’Keeffe as Lizzie Shelby looking at the camera in Peaky Blinders
Despite how frequently Tommy mistreated Lizzie over the course of the series, the two had a child together and even got married, which made her one of the franchise's most crucial characters. While many characters have had relationships with Tommy, no one knows him quite as well as Lizzie. Tommy had multiple business partners, love interests, and gang associates, but Lizzie was one of the few characters who could truly see the protagonist's flaws and was the most influential in trying to make him a better man.

This makes her return in the movie inevitable as Tommy's appearance all but confirms Lizzie will be back as well. Their relationship may not be perfect, but Lizzie is still his wife, and it only makes sense for her to return alongside him, especially as she was a critical part of Tommy surviving the final season. O'Keeffe is also one of the unsung heroes of the Peaky Blinders franchise, and she deserves a chance to bring one of her most iconic characters to the big screen.

Sophie Rundle As Ada Thorne
Ada Helped Keep The Family Shelby Together
Sophie Rundle seated as Ada Shelby Thorne in Peaky Blinders season 6.
Ada proved to be the rock of the Shelby family in Peaky Blinders, and no matter how much she tried to get away from all the trouble, she was always pulled back in. While she may not have been overly involved in the criminal element, Ada's connections have definitely helped her brothers on more than one occasion, and she will still be a valuable member of the family in the future. Ada was a mainstay on the show, but she wasn't always at the center of the story, and her movie role could be similar.

Like some of the previous entries, she may have a more limited role in the film, potentially even just a small cameo, but excluding her from the project entirely would make it feel incomplete. Sophie Rundle's talent was constantly on show whenever she was on-screen, and there's no doubt she could do a fabulous job as Ada one more time. Although Ada managed to move on from the death of her partner, she never got the proper ending she deserved, and the Peaky Blinders movie offers the chance for her to close her story for good.

Paul Anderson As Arthur Shelby
Arthur Has To Continue Being Tommy's Right-Hand Man
Arthur Shelby looking to his left in Peaky Blinders.
Of all the Peaky Blinders characters that must return for the movie, Arthur Shelby is at the top of the list. Arthur had some tremendous character development throughout his time on the show, and despite all the pain, tragedy, and loss he faced, Arthur remained Tommy's right-hand man until the very end. The two brothers fought on numerous occasions and were often a bad influence on each other, but they remained loyal to their family and the Peaky Blinders.

Arthur's unfiltered rage and humorous moments made him one of Peaky Blinders' best characters and he seems more likely to return than anyone. Even if the movie kept Tommy away from the gang and his business, Arthur is clearly one of the people closest to him, meaning he could be involved regardless of the storyline. Paul Anderson did a fantastic job bringing Arthur to life, and as long as the script is good enough, he seems ready for a return which would help elevate the Peaky Blinders film.


Peaky Blinders
Peaky Blinders is a historical crime drama created and written by Steven Knight and starring Cillian Murphy, Sam Neill, and Helen McCrory. The television show is based on the gang, Peaky Blinders, a group that banded together after the end of World War I.

WHY SYNACK HACKERS IS THE BEST PHONE SPYING APP.

Amazing and most impressive app. I was able to do this quite easily without stress. I was quite impressed with all the results that I got. I was able to catch my cheating spouse red handed by seeing everything on his phone remotely from my own phone. SYNACKHACKERS (at,, proton dot(.)me )delivered as promised, being able to see all his messages and call log was extremely useful. Everything works perfectly more than my imaginations and i give special shout out to them for their incredible services.
